    <p>Emacs (Editor MACroS) is a family of text editors that are characterized
      by their <strong>extensibility</strong>. Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands and its
      user interface allows the user to <strong>combine these commands</strong> into macaros to
      automate work.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>

      <p>Richard Stallman began work on GNU Emacs in 1984 to produce a
      free software alternative to the proprietary Gosling Emacs.
      GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement
      of its Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that
      nearly all of its code be rewritten. This became the first program
      released by the nascent GNU Project.</p>
